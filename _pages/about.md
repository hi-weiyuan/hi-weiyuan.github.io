I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Queensland (UQ), working with [Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home). My research mainly focuses on Recommender Systems and Decentralized Learning, Urban Computing, AI Security, and using LLMs for the above areas efficiently and securely. <!-- Knowledge Graph, Natural Language Processing, and AI for Software Engineering.  -->Before at UQ, I received my Master's degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn) supervised by A/Prof. Tieke He. 

📣📣📣   
*I am currently on the academic job market, seeking <font color=red><b>faculty (anywhere on the earth) or postdoctoral positions (USA, EU, Singapore), as well as Research Assistant Professor (RAP) opportunities (Hong Kong, USA).</b></font>
If you are aware of any openings for which I may be a good fit, I would greatly appreciate your reaching out at w.yuan[AT]uq.edu.au. Thank you.* 🙏

<!--Outside of research, I like powerlifting and swimming. -->
