I am a second-year PhD student at the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland (UQ), supervised by [A/Prof. Hongzhi Yin](https://sites.google.com/view/hongzhi-yin/home). My research focuses on Recommender Systems and Decentralized Learning. <!-- Knowledge Graph, Natural Language Processing, and AI for Software Engineering.  -->Before at UQ, I received my Master's degree from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn). Outside of research, I like powerlifting and swimming.
